{"text": " It's very difficult. Yeah, I don't know why. Congress was just stubborn about it until the last year they hadn't been able to get up as 50 percent of the time and so the teachers were screaming and they were split and the kids up and putting them in other classrooms. Well, I don't know if the parents made anything about it, but I guess finally, you know, when you have 50 percent of your classrooms uncovered, they came to it and it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute. The kids, the principal or the other teachers. But now it's like, well, thank you for coming. So I said, maybe that worked a little bit, but now just in the last two weeks, I think a lot of the retired teachers who weren't messing around with it have come back in. So I don't know exactly what the, yeah. So what's the stock you've been coming from? Well, when I came back from Oregon, my father was very ill and so I didn't want full time work and I started substituting out in Licking County, which paid terribly load. There's all these little districts that have a superintendent. Well, now they have two elementary, one middle school, one high school, and a superintendent, which they don't need, you know. So they have straight out of college, always. And there is a law that you have to pay for your accumulated time. So I couldn't get a job out there because I had about six years experience they had to pay me for. So I came back into Columbus and it's a lot harder to work in Columbus public, but I know the territory. I know where I'm going. The population is much different, yes. Well, you have an urban area with a lot of poor children, a lot of single parent families. And just the population is changing period from the two parent family, very, the mother not working into one parent with the mother working. It makes a big difference in how the child does at school. Yes, it's definitely having effect on children and the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it, but they aren't doing it yet. Whether they will be able to pick up enough by changing the way they teach and so on in the next 20 years, I don't know. But I'm glad my children went to school when they did. And I stayed home with them. You should be real attentive to what's happening in his school situation, his or her. Yeah, you should be where all where because the school has a big impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now. So, you know, but you can tell how your child's doing, of course. At this point, I'm not against the urban schools, but if it was my own personal child, I wouldn't move to a suburban area and tell Columbus gets their act together. They are in such bad shape right now that I do think the state will take over the Columbus Public Schools in two years. Yeah, they've threatened it. And if they don't pull their scores up, they will, you know. No. Well, my opinion changes from day to day on whose fault it is. Actually, at this point in time, I don't know whose fault it is. I think it's the fault of evolution. Well, I could have been prevented, but we didn't know it was going to happen that our society was going to change so intensely and we kind of hung back and thought things would stay the same way they were. And they haven't, everybody's changing it, especially the younger people. And we weren't ready and we didn't change fast enough. We didn't get ready for the change that was coming. Columbus, it seems to be. I mean, it's just like, well. It's just, it's just what the future is going to do. I at this point out, blame it on the administration. And the citizens of Columbus haven't, I mean, two years ago or was it three years ago now. They defeated a levy, you should never defeat a school levy. You know, they never asked for extra money and they had to cut back on everything. And I think I just set people back now. We're trying real hard to catch up. And at some point, we're going to, you know, have to put a levy on again. And who knows what's happened. We're keeping Rosa Smith right now because she's so good PR with the, with the business community. But the business community in Columbus doesn't really support the schools. And they don't. I mean, we've got two new stadiums and we haven't got any increase in school funding.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 10.120000000000001, "end": 12.66, "text": " It's very difficult.",

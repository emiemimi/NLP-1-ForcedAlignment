{"text": " I'm sitting here now, Scott. I bet you all Monday night's game tonight, nine o'clock, like a lot of sudden, so it went. You know, when don't exchange any money or having money figures planned out, just, you know, oh, well, that's your team. That's my team, let's go at it. Yeah, and it makes it, you know, fun. So you can actually see what, you know, you're studying these teams does, you know? You can go a whole season, you know, 17, 18 and out. And nobody's pretty much coming close to your standard, and when you win all that money, it's just like, yeah, when you lose all that money, it's like, that's it. I'm going home, but I've known people gamble, you know, compulsively. I mean, it's like a gambler's anonymous level. And I couldn't really get into that number one. I'm not the richest person in the world. And number two, just little money hears one thing, but when you're out there spending your car insurance money on it or rent money, then you got a real problem there. I've seen guys do that, too. Get down the side of the downs and bet the farm on one horse and wouldn't even do anything for him. Yes, you might get more, good, more, more gaming around the city. Well, you get the Casino's Riverboat Casino's open. You get all the pretty much every store on the corners, got a lottery machine or tickets. I think it is a good idea, because I want my fair share of money, a lot of, they give everybody a fair chance. You know, they don't just minimize it to one or two. You know, some of them have options and some of them don't. Yeah, it's just like having alcohol around. I mean, gambling is a lot like alcohol. It can be a dick thing. It could screw your life up and you'll spend your last dollar on it if you're that far gone. So pretty much anything can be one of those factors. Well, most people think it's something they rely on. Well, the money getting from the lottery to the people or lottery to schools. On that issue, then yeah, I agree with the gambling thing. Now, just as long as it's like social drinking in a sense, because if you have people just go out like today, I bought a one-dollar lottery ticket, one-two bucks off of it. So I kept my one-dollar and got a one-dollar ad known. Yeah, there's... And then there's these little bit more expensive cards, you buy the lottery cards, one of them's called Battleship that I've won a lot of money off of. Well, you have to... It's just like bingo numbers. And you... It's just like the game battleship, pretty much. You know, A4, A2, A7. And well, off of $3 one, I've won probably four out of five, you know, in that... I haven't bought that many of them, but in that race right there, four out of five's not too bad. You got my mom one on her birthday, she got $15. And the other times I get on my $3 back, or I won $9. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That could really bite you in the back though, winning all that money. I'd be... Well, I'd be quite content with $1 million, but $10 million is kind of like an overkill. I mean, do you think anybody in this town has $10 million? Well, maybe a couple of people, yeah. Yeah, probably have to go to Dublin or, you know, Worthing to somewhere around there to find a couple millionaires. But... I guess you could get two left. Hmm. Yeah. I'd give some charity and keep carry your bills, and probably go on that vacation you've been dying for, like you're making my brain water here ever australia. Well, yeah. It's kind of like making your mouth water when you see food. Yeah. And this is my consent to let you use that. Yeah. Oh, okay. Sorry. So, you went to school in Columbus? Mm-hmm. So, what school did you go to? I went to a lot of middle school. I went to Clinton and Indianola. High school, I went to Brookhaven and Fort Hayes. Wow, there were... Yeah, one's an alternative school, and the other one's just a regular trashy public school. Well, this is about giving opinions, and my opinion about the Columbus Public School system really isn't good. Why is that? Well, because I've been in public schools all my life, and I should be first to know that there's a lot of favoritism, you know, some teachers will teach one, but not teach the other. Well, yeah, teach one person one thing, and not teach the other person that. Kind of... Let me see here. And given an example, there's a... There's a school that they showed on 2020, somewhere out west, I believe it's Nevada or somewhere, and they said that these teachers have the highest rating among many other teachers in the nation because of their actual sitting down, hands on, critiquing these children. ex-girlfriend of mine, she was pretty much... I wouldn't put her borderline illiterate, but she didn't know how to read or write.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.49999999999999867, "end": 2.0, "text": " I'm sitting here now,

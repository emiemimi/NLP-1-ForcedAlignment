start;end;utterance
10.120000000000001;10.82; It's
10.82;11.08; very
11.08;12.66; difficult.
13.96;14.66; Yeah,
14.66;15.36; I
15.36;15.56; don't
15.56;15.8; know
15.8;16.4; why.
16.82;17.08; Congress
17.08;17.46; was
17.46;17.74; just
17.74;18.0; stubborn
18.0;18.36; about
18.36;18.66; it
18.66;19.18; until
19.18;19.6; the
19.6;20.02; last
20.02;20.84; year
20.84;21.96; they
21.96;22.3; hadn't
22.3;22.56; been
22.56;22.88; able
22.88;22.98; to
22.98;23.32; get
23.32;23.44; up
23.44;23.62; as
23.62;23.98; 50
23.98;25.8; percent
25.8;26.08; of
26.08;26.3; the
26.3;26.58; time
26.58;26.94; and
26.94;27.0; so
27.0;27.2; the
27.2;27.48; teachers
27.48;27.78; were
27.78;28.16; screaming
28.16;28.82; and
28.82;28.92; they
28.92;29.08; were
29.08;29.38; split
29.38;29.54; and
29.54;29.7; the
29.7;29.84; kids
29.84;30.12; up
30.12;30.22; and
30.22;30.46; putting
30.46;30.78; them
30.78;30.9; in
30.9;31.16; other
31.16;31.62; classrooms.
32.42;32.42; Well,
32.7;32.8; I
32.8;32.98; don't
32.98;33.18; know
33.18;33.24; if
33.24;33.5; the
33.5;33.74; parents
33.74;34.38; made
34.38;35.06; anything
35.06;35.46; about
35.46;35.66; it,
35.78;35.78; but
35.78;35.96; I
35.96;36.34; guess
36.34;37.02; finally,
37.56;37.58; you
37.58;37.78; know,
37.92;37.98; when
37.98;38.28; you
38.28;38.54; have
38.54;38.94; 50
38.94;39.32; percent
39.32;39.44; of
39.44;39.66; your
39.66;40.08; classrooms
40.08;40.92; uncovered,
42.16;42.2; they
42.2;42.74; came
42.74;42.94; to
42.94;43.14; it
43.14;43.18; and
43.18;43.44; it
43.44;43.62; got
43.62;43.82; so
43.82;44.1; used
44.1;44.3; to
44.3;44.38; be
44.38;44.76; nobody
44.76;45.42; appreciated
45.42;45.86; a
45.86;46.18; substitute.
47.36;47.38; The
47.38;47.68; kids,
47.86;47.94; the
47.94;48.2; principal
48.2;48.54; or
48.54;48.74; the
48.74;48.92; other
48.92;49.26; teachers.
49.5;49.56; But
49.56;49.76; now
49.76;50.06; it's
50.06;50.24; like,
50.3;50.52; well,
50.68;50.72; thank
50.72;50.9; you
50.9;51.08; for
51.08;51.38; coming.
52.24000000000001;52.84; So
52.84;53.26; I
53.26;53.44; said,
53.7;53.7; maybe
53.7;54.02; that
54.02;54.28; worked
54.28;54.44; a
54.44;54.6; little
54.6;54.86; bit,
55.16;55.16; but
55.16;55.46; now
55.46;55.74; just
55.74;55.9; in
55.9;56.0; the
56.0;56.3; last
56.3;56.58; two
56.58;57.08; weeks,
57.56;57.56; I
57.56;57.92; think
57.92;58.14; a
58.14;58.26; lot
58.26;58.42; of
58.42;58.56; the
58.56;58.82; retired
58.82;59.36; teachers
59.36;59.68; who
59.68;59.86; weren't
59.86;60.22; messing
60.22;60.68; around
60.68;60.96; with
60.96;61.14; it
61.14;61.32; have
61.32;61.52; come
61.52;61.88; back
61.88;62.84; in.
63.08;63.08; So
63.08;63.2; I
63.2;63.44; don't
63.44;63.68; know
63.68;64.0; exactly
64.0;64.22; what
64.22;64.68; the,
64.74;65.18; yeah.
66.2;66.36; So
66.36;69.02; what's
69.02;69.56; the
69.56;69.58; stock
69.58;69.96; you've
69.96;70.02; been
70.02;70.4; coming
70.4;70.72; from?
72.54;73.14; Well,
73.42;73.96; when
73.96;74.08; I
74.08;74.5; came
74.5;75.3; back
75.3;75.6; from
75.6;75.96; Oregon,
76.56;76.68; my
76.68;77.02; father
77.02;77.38; was
77.38;77.72; very
77.72;78.16; ill
78.16;78.76; and
78.76;79.04; so
79.04;79.1; I
79.1;79.4; didn't
79.4;79.6; want
79.6;79.88; full
79.88;80.18; time
80.18;80.42; work
80.42;80.58; and
80.58;80.74; I
80.74;81.12; started
81.12;81.86; substituting
81.86;82.28; out
82.28;82.78; in
82.78;83.12; Licking
83.12;84.62; County,
85.64;85.68; which
85.68;86.44; paid
86.44;87.58; terribly
87.58;88.24; load.
88.9;89.22; There's
89.22;89.34; all
89.34;89.58; these
89.58;89.94; little
89.94;90.34; districts
90.34;90.74; that
90.74;91.1; have
91.1;91.5; a
91.5;91.94; superintendent.
92.82;92.9; Well,
93.0;93.1; now
93.1;93.2; they
93.2;93.36; have
93.36;93.64; two
93.64;93.94; elementary,
94.14;94.38; one
94.38;94.62; middle
94.62;94.88; school,
94.9;95.08; one
95.08;95.34; high
95.34;95.56; school,
95.72;95.72; and
95.72;95.82; a
95.82;96.28; superintendent,
96.58;96.7; which
96.7;96.96; they
96.96;97.18; don't
97.18;97.54; need,
97.68;97.68; you
97.68;97.88; know.
98.38;98.5; So
98.5;98.9; they
98.9;99.04; have
99.04;99.7; straight
99.7;100.06; out
100.06;100.24; of
100.24;100.44; college,
100.84;100.86; always.
101.62;101.62; And
101.62;101.96; there
101.96;102.2; is
102.2;102.36; a
102.36;102.58; law
102.58;102.86; that
102.86;103.44; you
103.44;103.66; have
103.66;103.84; to
103.84;104.46; pay
104.46;104.88; for
104.88;105.12; your
105.12;105.66; accumulated
105.66;106.4; time.
106.4;107.02; So
107.02;107.2; I
107.2;107.46; couldn't
107.46;107.66; get
107.66;107.86; a
107.86;108.08; job
108.08;108.4; out
108.4;108.56; there
108.56;108.88; because
108.88;109.08; I
109.08;109.3; had
109.3;109.66; about
109.66;109.88; six
109.88;110.16; years
110.16;110.78; experience
110.78;111.0; they
111.0;111.26; had
111.26;111.44; to
111.44;111.46; pay
111.46;111.74; me
111.74;112.34; for.
112.62;112.72; So
112.72;112.78; I
112.78;113.02; came
113.02;113.38; back
113.38;113.74; into
113.74;114.12; Columbus
114.12;114.36; and
114.36;114.64; it's
114.64;114.76; a
114.76;114.92; lot
114.92;115.22; harder
115.22;115.44; to
115.44;115.7; work
115.7;115.94; in
115.94;116.26; Columbus
116.26;116.74; public,
117.22;117.96; but
117.96;119.22; I
119.22;119.58; know
119.58;119.9; the
119.9;120.32; territory.
120.32;120.64; I
120.64;120.78; know
120.78;121.02; where
121.02;121.26; I'm
121.26;121.54; going.
123.36;123.92; The
123.92;124.48; population
124.48;125.1; is
125.1;125.5; much
125.5;125.96; different,
126.92;126.92; yes.
128.82;128.98; Well,
129.16;129.36; you
129.36;130.4; have
130.4;130.56; an
130.56;130.86; urban
130.86;131.3; area
131.3;131.66; with
131.66;131.8; a
131.8;131.92; lot
131.92;132.16; of
132.16;132.38; poor
132.38;133.1; children,
134.14;134.2; a
134.2;134.28; lot
134.28;134.5; of
134.5;134.76; single
134.76;135.18; parent
135.18;135.64; families.
135.64;135.9; And
135.9;136.2; just
136.2;136.6; the
136.6;137.06; population
137.06;137.5; is
137.5;137.82; changing
137.82;138.5; period
138.5;139.5; from
139.5;139.92; the
139.92;140.18; two
140.18;140.52; parent
140.52;141.16; family,
141.84;141.84; very,
142.02;142.32; the
142.32;142.56; mother
142.56;142.84; not
142.84;143.28; working
143.28;143.94; into
143.94;144.6; one
144.6;144.94; parent
144.94;145.34; with
145.34;145.52; the
145.52;145.84; mother
145.84;146.24; working.
146.36;146.38; It
146.38;146.62; makes
146.62;146.8; a
146.8;147.06; big
147.06;147.44; difference
147.44;147.72; in
147.72;148.52; how
148.52;148.74; the
148.74;148.86; child
148.86;149.24; does
149.24;149.52; at
149.52;149.9; school.
156.28;156.94; Yes,
156.94;157.28; it's
157.28;157.6; definitely
157.6;157.98; having
157.98;158.52; effect
158.52;158.88; on
158.88;159.76; children
159.76;161.02; and
161.02;162.08; the
162.08;162.38; schools
162.38;162.64; are
162.64;162.94; trying
162.94;163.2; to
163.2;163.44; catch
163.44;163.78; up
163.78;163.84; or
163.84;164.12; make
164.12;164.36; up
164.36;164.58; for
164.58;164.66; it,
164.66;164.86; but
164.86;164.98; they
164.98;165.18; aren't
165.18;165.52; doing
165.52;165.84; it
165.84;166.16; yet.
166.42;166.6; Whether
166.6;166.86; they
166.86;167.1; will
167.1;167.22; be
167.22;167.5; able
167.5;167.64; to
167.64;167.84; pick
167.84;168.14; up
168.14;169.16; enough
169.16;170.96; by
170.96;171.6; changing
171.6;171.86; the
171.86;171.94; way
171.94;172.18; they
172.18;172.46; teach
172.46;172.64; and
172.64;172.86; so
172.86;173.08; on
173.08;173.22; in
173.22;173.32; the
173.32;173.6; next
173.6;173.84; 20
173.84;174.26; years,
174.44;174.44; I
174.44;174.72; don't
174.72;175.34; know.
175.94;175.94; But
175.94;176.46; I'm
176.46;176.64; glad
176.64;176.86; my
176.86;177.26; children
177.26;177.62; went
177.62;177.8; to
177.8;178.0; school
178.0;178.24; when
178.24;178.42; they
178.42;178.92; did.
180.02;180.2; And
180.2;180.38; I
180.38;180.64; stayed
180.64;180.94; home
180.94;181.16; with
181.16;181.8; them.
185.35999999999999;185.92; You
185.92;186.26; should
186.26;186.98; be
186.98;187.38; real
187.38;187.82; attentive
187.82;188.16; to
188.16;188.54; what's
188.54;188.8; happening
188.8;189.08; in
189.08;189.36; his
189.36;189.64; school
189.64;190.42; situation,
190.92;190.96; his
190.96;191.14; or
191.14;191.92; her.
193.26;193.76; Yeah,
193.86;194.08; you
194.08;194.3; should
194.3;194.56; be
194.56;194.82; where
194.82;195.02; all
195.02;195.34; where
195.34;195.78; because
195.78;196.04; the
196.04;196.28; school
196.28;196.56; has
196.56;196.7; a
196.7;196.88; big
196.88;197.82; impact
197.82;198.06; on
198.06;198.26; the
198.26;198.58; children
198.58;198.86; and
198.86;199.22; sometimes
199.22;199.7; not
199.7;199.98; all
199.98;200.3; that
200.3;200.72; positive
200.72;201.22; right
201.22;201.9; now.
202.74;202.74; So,
203.24;203.32; you
203.32;203.52; know,
203.64;203.8; but
203.8;203.88; you
203.88;204.12; can
204.12;204.62; tell
204.62;205.06; how
205.06;205.3; your
205.3;205.76; child's
205.76;206.02; doing,
206.12;206.28; of
206.28;206.48; course.
214.38;214.94; At
214.94;215.24; this
215.24;216.84; point,
217.24;217.56; I'm
217.56;217.56; not
217.56;219.12; against
219.12;219.4; the
219.4;219.72; urban
219.72;220.12; schools,
220.28;220.32; but
220.32;220.54; if
220.54;220.7; it
220.7;220.96; was
220.96;221.18; my
221.18;221.4; own
221.4;221.78; personal
221.78;222.12; child,
222.34;222.34; I
222.34;222.66; wouldn't
222.66;223.38; move
223.38;223.7; to
223.7;223.74; a
223.74;224.18; suburban
224.18;224.64; area
224.64;224.76; and
224.76;224.96; tell
224.96;225.3; Columbus
225.3;225.6; gets
225.6;225.88; their
225.88;226.1; act
226.1;226.46; together.
227.14;227.14; They
227.14;227.32; are
227.32;227.8; in
227.8;228.4; such
228.4;228.8; bad
228.8;229.08; shape
229.08;229.4; right
229.4;229.68; now
229.68;230.24; that
230.24;230.52; I
230.52;230.66; do
230.66;230.88; think
230.88;231.1; the
231.1;231.28; state
231.28;231.52; will
231.52;231.76; take
231.76;232.02; over
232.02;232.24; the
232.24;232.48; Columbus
232.48;232.82; Public
232.82;233.24; Schools
233.24;233.46; in
233.46;233.66; two
233.66;234.04; years.
234.04;234.36; Yeah,
234.94;235.12; they've
235.12;235.46; threatened
235.46;236.18; it.
237.1;237.22; And
237.22;237.4; if
237.4;237.66; they
237.66;238.0; don't
238.0;238.32; pull
238.32;238.84; their
238.84;239.26; scores
239.26;240.16; up,
240.52;240.74; they
240.74;241.68; will,
241.74;246.68; you
246.68;247.08; know.
247.08;247.18; No.
251.62;252.34; Well,
253.6;254.08; my
254.08;254.48; opinion
254.48;255.04; changes
255.04;255.4; from
255.4;255.6; day
255.6;255.8; to
255.8;255.86; day
255.86;256.08; on
256.08;256.32; whose
256.32;256.58; fault
256.58;256.76; it
256.76;257.16; is.
259.26;259.78; Actually,
262.0;262.0; at
262.0;262.38; this
262.38;262.64; point
262.64;262.96; in
262.96;263.34; time,
263.58;263.62; I
263.62;263.82; don't
263.82;264.04; know
264.04;264.38; whose
264.38;264.68; fault
264.68;264.78; it
264.78;265.46; is.
265.94;266.02; I
266.02;266.26; think
266.26;266.8; it's
266.8;266.92; the
266.92;267.56; fault
267.56;267.76; of
267.76;268.38; evolution.
271.72;272.24; Well,
272.24;272.42; I
272.42;272.62; could
272.62;272.76; have
272.76;272.96; been
272.96;273.3; prevented,
273.66;273.66; but
273.66;273.8; we
273.8;274.06; didn't
274.06;274.22; know
274.22;274.34; it
274.34;274.42; was
274.42;274.56; going
274.56;274.66; to
274.66;274.98; happen
274.98;275.76; that
275.76;276.04; our
276.04;276.48; society
276.48;276.76; was
276.76;276.88; going
276.88;276.98; to
276.98;277.32; change
277.32;277.58; so
277.58;277.92; intensely
277.92;278.36; and
278.36;278.36; we
278.36;278.82; kind
278.82;279.12; of
279.12;279.26; hung
279.26;279.6; back
279.6;279.76; and
279.76;279.98; thought
279.98;280.28; things
280.28;280.52; would
280.52;280.74; stay
280.74;280.98; the
280.98;281.16; same
281.16;281.36; way
281.36;281.56; they
281.56;281.82; were.
281.82;281.98; And
281.98;282.12; they
282.12;282.38; haven't,
282.52;283.24; everybody's
283.24;283.56; changing
283.56;284.2; it,
284.36;284.52; especially
284.52;284.88; the
284.88;285.16; younger
285.16;285.78; people.
287.32000000000005;287.84000000000003; And
287.84000000000003;288.36; we
288.36;288.6; weren't
288.6;288.88; ready
288.88;289.02; and
289.02;289.12; we
289.12;289.36; didn't
289.36;289.78; change
289.78;290.16; fast
290.16;290.42; enough.
290.42;290.66; We
290.66;290.9; didn't
290.9;291.18; get
291.18;291.44; ready
291.44;291.68; for
291.68;291.86; the
291.86;292.3; change
292.3;292.56; that
292.56;292.82; was
292.82;293.14; coming.
296.14000000000004;296.66; Columbus,
297.12;297.24; it
297.24;297.5; seems
297.5;297.78; to
297.78;298.12; be.
298.96;299.12; I
299.12;299.32; mean,
299.52;299.62; it's
299.62;299.88; just
299.88;300.28; like,
300.28;300.84; well.
300.84;301.3; It's
301.3;301.94; just,
302.2;303.04; it's
303.04;303.04; just
303.04;303.18; what
303.18;303.52; the
303.52;303.68; future
303.68;304.06; is
304.06;304.06; going
304.06;304.48; to
304.48;305.14; do.
306.16;306.56; I
306.56;306.96; at
306.96;307.24; this
307.24;307.46; point
307.46;307.7; out,
307.7;307.8; blame
307.8;308.0; it
308.0;308.08; on
308.08;308.24; the
308.24;308.94; administration.
314.62;314.78; And
314.78;314.96; the
314.96;315.34; citizens
315.34;315.74; of
315.74;316.1; Columbus
316.1;316.72; haven't,
316.76;316.84; I
316.84;317.22; mean,
317.42;317.58; two
317.58;317.88; years
317.88;318.4; ago
318.4;318.62; or
318.62;318.84; was
318.84;318.96; it
318.96;319.18; three
319.18;319.46; years
319.46;319.76; ago
319.76;320.28; now.
320.6;320.68; They
320.68;321.08; defeated
321.08;321.4; a
321.4;321.82; levy,
322.02;322.1; you
322.1;322.26; should
322.26;322.58; never
322.58;322.96; defeat
322.96;323.26; a
323.26;323.46; school
323.46;323.82; levy.
324.08;324.08; You
324.08;324.2; know,
324.3;324.36; they
324.36;324.78; never
324.78;325.14; asked
325.14;325.32; for
325.32;325.62; extra
325.62;325.98; money
325.98;326.98; and
326.98;327.7; they
327.7;327.9; had
327.9;328.0; to
328.0;328.2; cut
328.2;328.54; back
328.54;328.7; on
328.7;329.06; everything.
329.06;329.26; And
329.26;329.58; I
329.58;329.82; think
329.82;330.06; I
330.06;330.22; just
330.22;330.4; set
330.4;330.7; people
330.7;331.02; back
331.02;331.24; now.
331.36;331.4; We're
331.4;331.66; trying
331.66;331.86; real
331.86;332.1; hard
332.1;332.22; to
332.22;332.42; catch
332.42;332.88; up.
333.24;333.24; And
333.24;333.48; at
333.48;333.64; some
333.64;334.0; point,
334.18;334.2; we're
334.2;334.58; going
334.58;336.08; to,
336.08;336.14; you
336.14;336.46; know,
336.6;336.74; have
336.74;336.86; to
336.86;337.12; put
337.12;337.18; a
337.18;337.46; levy
337.46;337.76; on
337.76;338.04; again.
340.2;340.2; And
340.2;340.94; who
340.94;341.18; knows
341.18;341.56; what's
341.56;341.86; happened.
342.16;342.36; We're
342.36;342.68; keeping
342.68;343.04; Rosa
343.04;343.46; Smith
343.46;343.8; right
343.8;343.94; now
343.94;344.34; because
344.34;345.2; she's
345.2;345.44; so
345.44;345.9; good
345.9;346.36; PR
346.36;347.04; with
347.04;347.04; the,
347.04;347.5; with
347.5;347.86; the
347.86;348.2; business
348.2;348.86; community.
349.14;349.44; But
349.44;349.58; the
349.58;349.94; business
349.94;350.54; community
350.54;350.76; in
350.76;351.12; Columbus
351.12;351.56; doesn't
351.56;351.9; really
351.9;352.28; support
352.28;352.56; the
352.56;353.04; schools.
353.32;353.4; And
353.4;353.58; they
353.58;354.02; don't.
354.02;354.64; I
354.64;354.86; mean,
355.02;355.14; we've
355.14;355.32; got
355.32;355.54; two
355.54;356.1; new
356.1;357.22; stadiums
357.22;357.38; and
357.38;357.5; we
357.5;357.8; haven't
357.8;358.02; got
358.02;358.3; any
358.3;358.74; increase
358.74;359.06; in
359.06;359.32; school
359.32;359.62; funding.
